    #
    # Alternatively, if you just want to distribute a single Python file, use
    # the `py_modules` argument instead as follows, which will expect a file
    # called `my_module.py` to exist:

    # To provide executable scripts, use entry points in preference to the

    #
    # For example, the following would provide a command called `sample` which
    # executes the function `main` from this package when invoked:
